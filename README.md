## Experienced Front-end Developer
<p>Passionate, Collaborative and Highly Skilled Full Stack Web Developer with 6+ years of professional experience in dynamic and deadline-driven work environments. 
I am always trying harder to find new and more effective ways to solve problems.</p>

<p>Communication with the client is a crucial part of web development and I make it a priority to be responsive as well as report regularly on the development process.
I like to work with businesses with a clear vision for excellent software products. You will not get any price estimation until we have talked extensively about what you want to achieve. </p>

<p>If you have an idea and don't know how to realize it, I will help you to kick-start it. 
Asking the right key questions is the most part at the beginning of every project. Only good project management delivers your business reliable software in a plannable time frame.</p>
